** Attribution
I've found various corners online, but that was quite a while ago. The
majority appear to be by [[http://www.freepik.com][designed by callmetak / Freepik]]. They are free for
use, but see the license on that site for details.

If you know the source for other corners, then please let me know, so I can
properly attribute them as well.

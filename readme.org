* filigree
** Requirements
Required $\LaTeX$ packages:
- ~tikz~ and its ~calc~ library
- ~graphicx~
- ~xparse~
- ~adjustbox~
- ~ifthen~

** Usage
1. Include ~filigree.tex~ in your document:
   #+begin_src latex
\input{./filigree.tex}
   #+end_src
2. Use the ~\filibox~ macro:
   #+begin_src latex
\filibox[width=6cm, height=4cm, corner=style-single-3, cornersize=1cm, mode=full, lines=1]
  {Your content...}
   #+end_src
*** Options
- ~width~ :: The width of the box. Default: ~5cm~.
- ~height~ :: The height of the box. Default: ~4cm~.
- ~cornersize~ :: The width of the corner piece. Default: ~0.5cm~. Note: some
  corners are intended to be smaller, which also results in thicker lines, when
  they are scaled up. For those it usually is more visually pleasing to reduce
  this size.
- ~corner~ :: The style of the corners, see style overview below. Default: ~style-double-02~.
- ~mode~ :: The mode of corner inclusion, valid values are:
  - ~full~ :: all four corners
  - ~diagonal~ :: the top left and bottom right corners
  - ~antidiagonal~ :: the top right and bottom left corners
  Default: ~full~.
- ~lines~ :: The number of lines to draw, valid values are:
  - ~all~ :: 2 lines if the corner style supports them, otherwise 1
  - ~2~ :: 2 lines if the corner style supports them, otherwise
  - ~1~ :: 1 line
  - ~0~ :: no lines
  Default: ~all~. Note: by default there's always a line, even for the
  ~style-none-*~ styles, unless you explicitly specify ~lines=0~.
- ~padding~ :: Horizontal and vertical padding of the content box, e.g. ~0.2cm~.
  This is useful in particular because the corners and borders are included in
  the width/height. Default: ~0~.

** Attribution
I've found various corners online, but that was quite a while ago. The
majority appear to be by [[http://www.freepik.com][designed by callmetak / Freepik]]. They are free for
use, but see the license on that site for details.

If you know the source for other corners, then please let me know, so I can
properly attribute them as well.

** Development
